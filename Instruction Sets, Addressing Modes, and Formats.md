# 🧠 Chapter: Instruction Sets, Addressing Modes, and Formats

---

## 🌟 1. Introduction to Instruction Set Design

The **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** is the set of all instructions that a CPU can understand and execute.  
Each instruction tells the processor _what operation to perform_ and _where to find the data._

Designing an instruction set involves balancing:

- **Shorter instructions** (for speed and memory efficiency)
    
- **Flexibility** (to handle many types of operations)
    
- **Simplicity** (to make the CPU design efficient)
    

So, the **goal of instruction set design** is:

1. Minimize instruction length
    
2. Maximize flexibility (especially in CISC processors)
    
3. Support compiler needs efficiently
    

A key part of this design is the **addressing mode** — it defines **how an instruction finds its data (operands).**

---

## 🧩 2. What are Addressing Modes?

**Definition:**  
Addressing mode tells the CPU _where to get the operand (data)_ for an instruction.

Example:

```
ADD A, B
```

Here, A and B are operands. But — are they in registers? In memory? Immediate values?  
That’s what addressing modes define!

Each addressing mode is a different way of locating operands.

---

## 🧮 3. Common Addressing Modes

The main addressing modes are:

1. Immediate
    
2. Direct
    
3. Indirect
    
4. Register
    
5. Register Indirect
    
6. Displacement (Indexed)
    
7. Implied
    

Let’s go through each one step by step 👇

---

## ⚡ 4. Immediate Addressing Mode

**Definition:**  
The data (operand) is directly written _inside the instruction._

Example:

```
ADD EAX, 5
```

Here, the number **5** is part of the instruction itself.

**Advantages:**

- No memory access → very fast
    
- Saves time since the value is already available
    

**Disadvantages:**

- Value range is limited (since instruction size is fixed)
    

🧠 _Memory tip:_ Immediate = “immediately available” inside the instruction.

---

### 🧮 Example (Small Operands)

On 32-bit or 64-bit CPUs, immediate values are usually small (like 8 bits).  
The CPU may **extend** these values:

- **Zero-extension** for positive numbers
    
- **Sign-extension** for negative numbers
    

---

## 🧱 5. Direct Addressing Mode

**Definition:**  
The instruction gives the _memory address_ of the operand directly.

Formula:  
[  
EA = A  
]  
(EA = Effective Address)

Example:

```
ADD AX, [10FC]
```

Here, the data is stored at memory address **10FC**, and the CPU goes there to get it.

**Features:**

- Only one memory reference is needed (to get data)
    
- Simple and easy to understand
    

**Used in:** x86 architecture with instructions like:

```
MOV [0344], BX
ADD [00C018A0], EDX
```

🧠 _Trick:_ Direct = address is given _directly._

---

## 🧭 6. Memory-Indirect Addressing

**Definition:**  
The address field points to a _memory location_ that contains the _real address_ of the operand.

Formula:  
[  
EA = (A)  
]

Process:

1. Go to address A → find another address stored there
    
2. Use that second address to get the operand
    

**Advantage:** Very flexible, allows pointer-like access.  
**Disadvantage:** Requires two memory accesses.

🧠 _Think:_ “Indirect = Go there, then go again!”

---

## ⚙️ 7. Register Addressing

**Definition:**  
The operands are stored in CPU registers.

Formula:  
[  
EA = R  
]

Example:

```
ADD AX, BX
```

Here, both AX and BX are registers.

**Advantages:**

- No memory access → fastest
    
- Short instructions (since registers are few)
    

**Limitation:**

- Small number of registers → limited address space
    

🧠 _Trick:_ Register addressing = fastest because “data is already in hand.”

---

## 🔁 8. Register Indirect Addressing

**Definition:**  
The register holds the _memory address_ of the operand.

Formula:  
[  
EA = (R)  
]

Example:

```
MOV AX, [BX]
```

The register BX stores a memory address, and AX loads data from that address.

**Advantages:**

- Large address space
    
- Faster than full memory-indirect (only one memory access)
    

**Common Use:** Accessing arrays or pointers.

---

## 🧮 9. Displacement (Indexed) Addressing

**Definition:**  
A combination of **direct** and **register indirect** addressing.

Formula:  
[  
EA = A + (R)  
]

Where:

- A = base value
    
- R = register holding offset (or vice versa)
    

**Purpose:** Access arrays and data structures efficiently.

Types:

1. **Relative Addressing**
    
2. **Base-Register Addressing**
    
3. **Indexed Addressing**
    

---

### 📍 9.1 Relative Addressing (PC-relative)

- Effective Address (EA) = **A + (PC)**
    
- Used for jumps and branches in programs
    
- Helps programs run correctly even when moved in memory
    

🧠 _Tip:_ “Relative to PC” → good for loops and jumps.

---

### 🧱 9.2 Base-Register Addressing

- The base address is stored in a register (R)
    
- Displacement (A) adds to it
    

Example (x86):

```
MOV EAX, [EDI + 4 * ECX]
SUB [BX + SI - 12], 2
```

Useful when a program or data segment starts at a known base address.

---

### 🔢 9.3 Indexed Addressing

- Effective Address (EA) = A + R
    
- Commonly used for arrays.
    

Example:

```
MOV ESI, 1000   ; base
MOV ECX, 0      ; index
MOV EAX, [ESI + 4*ECX] ; first element
```

Then `ECX` increases to move to the next element → perfect for **loops and arrays.**

🧠 _Remember:_ Indexed = “base + index.”

---

## 💻 10. Pentium Addressing Modes (x86 Family)

x86 processors (like Pentium) support **12 addressing modes**, including:

- Immediate
    
- Register
    
- Displacement
    
- Base
    
- Base + displacement
    
- Scaled index
    
- Base + index + displacement
    
- Base scaled index + displacement
    
- Relative
    

They allow flexible access to complex data structures.

---

## 🧠 11. Quick Practice – Identify the Addressing Mode

|Instruction|Addressing Mode|
|---|---|
|`mov eax, 5`|Immediate|
|`add [0x1000], ebx`|Direct|
|`push [esi]`|Register Indirect|
|`sub eax, [ebx + 8]`|Displacement (Base + Displacement)|
|`inc dword ptr [eax + 4*ecx + 100]`|Indexed|

Try memorizing by _seeing the pattern:_

- Brackets `[]` → memory access
    
- Constant inside → direct/displacement
    
- Register + offset → indexed
    

---

|Mode|Description|Speed|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|Immediate|Value inside instruction|⚡ Fast|`MOV AX, 5`|
|Direct|Address is given directly|🚀 Medium|`MOV AX, [1000]`|

| **Direct (Displacement)**            | The instruction contains the **exact memory address** of the operand.                     | 🚀 Medium | `MOV AX, [1000]`                                | **EA = 1000**                                                    |
| **Indirect (Memory-Indirect)**       | The given address points to another memory location that contains the operand address.    | 🐢 Slow   | `MOV AX, [[1000]]`                              | **EA = (1000)** → content at address 1000 gives the real address |
| **Register**                         | Operand is inside a CPU register. No memory access.                                       | ⚡ Fastest | `ADD AX, BX`                                    | **EA = Register name (AX/BX)**                                   |
| **Register Indirect**                | Register holds a **memory address**, and the operand is fetched from that address.        | 🚀 Fast   | `MOV AX, [BX]`                                  | **EA = (BX)**                                                    |
| **Displacement (Base + Offset)**     | Combines a register’s content (base) and a constant offset.                               | 🚀 Fast   | `MOV AX, [BX + 4]`                              | **EA = BX + 4**                                                  |
| **Relative (PC-relative)**           | Effective address = current program counter + offset (used for jumps and branches).       | 🚀 Fast   | `JMP LOOP`                                      | **EA = PC + Offset**                                             |
| **Indexed (Base + Index)**           | Combines a base address and an index register (often with a scale factor for arrays).     | 🚀 Fast   | `MOV AX, [BASE + INDEX]` or `MOV AX, [SI + DI]` | **EA = Base + Index × Scale**                                    |
| **Base Scaled Index + Displacement** | Most flexible mode; combines base, index, scale, and displacement.                        | 🚀 Fast   | `MOV AX, [BX + 4*SI + 100]`                     | **EA = BX + (4 × SI) + 100**                                     |
