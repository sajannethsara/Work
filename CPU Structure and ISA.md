# üåü Chapter 1: Introduction to Computer Architecture

### What is Computer Architecture?

Computer architecture is the **blueprint** of a computer ‚Äî it explains **how the system‚Äôs parts work together** to process data and run programs.

It includes:

- **Design** of components (CPU, memory, I/O devices)
    
- **Organization** of these components and their interactions
    
- Both **hardware and software aspects** that affect performance
    

üß† _Think of computer architecture like the floor plan of a house ‚Äî it shows how everything connects._

---

## üß© Computer Architecture vs Computer Organization

|Aspect|Computer Architecture|Computer Organization|
|---|---|---|
|Focus|What the system **does**|How it **does** it|
|Visible to programmer?|‚úÖ Yes|‚ùå No|
|Examples|Instruction set, data types|Clock speed, memory size|
|Analogy|Blueprint of the house|The plumbing and wiring inside|

üí° **Tip to remember:**  
Architecture = _Visible (Logic)_  
Organization = _Invisible (Structure)_

---

## üß† Language of Instructions

Humans use languages like English or Sinhala,  
Computers use their own simple language ‚Äî called **machine instructions**.

For example:

```
ADD A, B
MUL A, B
```

The **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** is the **complete set of instructions** a CPU can execute.

üìò ISA defines what the processor can do ‚Äî add, move, multiply, compare, jump, etc.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features of a Good Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

A good ISA must be:

1. **Complete** ‚Äì can perform all necessary operations
    
2. **Concise** ‚Äì not too many instructions (usually 32‚Äì1000)
    
3. **Generic** ‚Äì not overly specific (avoid ‚Äúadd 15‚Äù type of instructions)
    
4. **Simple** ‚Äì easy for the CPU to execute
    

üß† _Easy way to remember ‚Üí CGCS: Complete, Generic, Concise, Simple._

---

## üèóÔ∏è Designing an ISA: Key Considerations

When designing an ISA, architects consider:

- Number and type of instructions
    
- Instruction complexity
    
- How data moves between memory and CPU
    

There are **two main ISA paradigms:**

### 1. RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)

- Fewer, simpler instructions (about 64‚Äì128)
    
- Easier and faster to execute
    
- Example: **ARM processors**
    

### 2. CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)

- Larger instruction set
    
- More complex operations in a single instruction
    
- Example: **Intel x86 processors**
    

üß† _Memory trick: RISC = ‚ÄúSimple & Speedy‚Äù, CISC = ‚ÄúComplex but Compact.‚Äù_

---

## ü™ú Levels of Machine Architecture

Computers work on several ‚Äúlevels‚Äù:

1. **User ISA Level** ‚Äì the part visible to the programmer
    
2. **System ISA Level** ‚Äì privileged instructions for the operating system
    
3. **Hardware Level** ‚Äì where physical execution happens
    

---

## üë∑ Role of a Computer Architect

A computer architect:

- Designs the ISA for **easy programming and good performance**
    
- Designs hardware for **efficient instruction execution**
    
- Balances performance, cost, and power
    
- Ensures compatibility with OS and applications
    

üí≠ There‚Äôs no single _best_ computer ‚Äî it depends on user needs and cost.

---

## üí∞ Computer Cost Factors

1. Hardware design cost
    
2. Software development cost (OS, apps)
    
3. Manufacturing cost
    
4. Price to the buyer
    

---

## ‚ö° Computer Performance Factors

Performance depends on:

- Program size and frequency
    
- Number of users
    
- I/O device speed
    
- Technology advancements
    
- Architecture innovation
    

---

## üïê Defining Performance

### Response Time

- Time taken from the **start to the end** of a task
    
- Also known as **execution time**
    

### Throughput

- Number of jobs done per second (like cars produced per hour in a factory)
    

üß† _Example:_  
If it takes 4 hours to make 1 car ‚Üí response time = 4h  
If factory produces 6 cars/hour ‚Üí throughput = 6 cars/hour

---

## üíª CPU Time ‚Äì True Measure of Processor Performance

CPU Time measures:

> How long the processor was _actually executing instructions_ (not waiting for I/O or multitasking).

It‚Äôs the best measure of how powerful the CPU is.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Cycles Per Instruction (CPI)

Every CPU has a **clock** ‚Äî a tiny oscillator that ticks billions of times per second.  
Each tick = one **cycle**.

- CPU speed = number of cycles per second (Hz, MHz, GHz)
    
- **CPI** = number of cycles required for one instruction
    

---

## üìê Factors Affecting Processor Performance

1. **Clock Rate** ‚Äì how fast the clock ticks
    
2. **CPI** ‚Äì cycles per instruction
    
3. **Instruction Count (IC)** ‚Äì number of instructions in a program
    

They are **interdependent** ‚Äî changing one can affect the others.

---

## üßÆ CPU Time Formula


$\text{CPU Time} = \text{Instruction Count} \times \text{CPI} \times \text{Clock Cycle Time}$  
$or$  
$\text{CPU Time} = \frac{\text{Instruction Count} \times \text{CPI}}{\text{Clock Rate}}$  


---

## üöÄ Performance Improvement Tips

- Faster clock ‚Üí may increase power use or complexity
    
- Lower CPI ‚Üí simpler instructions (RISC helps)
    
- Fewer instructions ‚Üí better compiler design
    

All must be balanced together.

---

## üß© Example Problem

**Given:**  
Program runs in 10s on 400 MHz CPU  
We want 6s runtime, but total cycles increase 1.2√ó

**Solution idea:**  
We need a higher clock rate to compensate for extra cycles.

Formula:  

$\text{New Clock Rate} = \text{Old Clock Rate} \times \frac{\text{New CPU Time} \times 1.2}{\text{Old CPU Time}}$  


---

## üèÅ Key Takeaways

- **Computer Architecture** = Design visible to programmers
    
- **ISA** = Defines what CPU can do
    
- **RISC** vs **CISC** = Simplicity vs Complexity
    
- **Performance** measured by CPU time, response time, throughput
    
- **CPU Time = IC √ó CPI √ó Clock Cycle Time**
    
- Optimization requires balancing all factors

# üåü Chapter 2: CPU Performance and Calculations

Performance is the heart of computer architecture.  
Every design decision ‚Äî clock rate, instruction set, or compiler choice ‚Äî ultimately aims to **improve performance**.

---

## ‚ö° 1. What Does "Performance" Mean?

Performance simply tells **how fast** a computer runs a program.

We can measure it in **two main ways:**

|For Users|For System Managers|
|---|---|
|**Response Time** ‚Äì how long it takes to finish one task|**Throughput** ‚Äì how many tasks are completed per unit time|

üß† **Trick to remember:**

> Response time = one program  
> Throughput = many programs

---

## üïê 2. Response Time (Execution Time)

**Response Time** is the total time between the start and the end of a program.

Example:

> If your game takes 10 seconds to load, its response time = 10s.

---

## üìä 3. Throughput

Throughput = Number of jobs completed per second (or hour).

Example:

> A factory makes 6 cars per hour ‚Üí throughput = 6 cars/hour.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
Throughput and response time are _not always linked._  
A system can complete more jobs (high throughput) without making individual jobs faster.

---

## üßÆ 4. CPU Time ‚Äî The True Measure

CPU time is **the time during which the CPU actually executes instructions** (excluding waiting for I/O, OS tasks, etc.).

Formula:  
$$
  
\text{CPU Time} = \text{CPU Clock Cycles} \times \text{Clock Cycle Time}  
  
$$
or  
$$

\text{CPU Time} = \frac{\text{CPU Clock Cycles}}{\text{Clock Rate}}  

$$

üß† **Memory tip:**  
More cycles ‚Üí more time  
Higher clock ‚Üí less time

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è 5. Clock Cycle and Clock Rate

- **Clock Cycle:** One tick of the CPU clock (the time between pulses)
    
- **Clock Rate:** Number of clock cycles per second
    

**Units:**

- 1 MHz = 1 million cycles/sec
    
- 1 GHz = 1 billion cycles/sec
    

Example:

> A 2 GHz processor = 2,000,000,000 cycles per second.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 6. CPI (Cycles Per Instruction)

Different instructions take different amounts of time.

- Simple instructions (like ADD) ‚Üí fewer cycles
    
- Complex ones (like DIV or LOAD) ‚Üí more cycles
    

 
$$
\text{CPI} = \frac{\text{Total Clock Cycles}}{\text{Instruction Count}}  
$$


üß† **Think:** CPI shows how many clock ticks one instruction needs on average.

---

## üî¢ 7. The Golden Formula for CPU Time

This is the most important formula in this topic ‚Äî memorize it!

$$
\boxed{\text{CPU Time} = \text{Instruction Count (IC)} \times \text{CPI} \times \text{Clock Cycle Time}}  
$$


or equivalently,


$$
\boxed{\text{CPU Time} = \frac{\text{IC} \times \text{CPI}}{\text{Clock Rate}}}  
$$


---

## üß© 8. Factors Affecting Processor Performance

|Factor|Description|Controlled by|
|---|---|---|
|**Clock Rate**|Speed of CPU cycles (GHz)|Hardware technology|
|**CPI**|How many cycles per instruction|ISA & CPU design|
|**Instruction Count (IC)**|How many instructions in a program|Compiler & programmer|

üß† **Trick:** Remember as the triangle:

```
     Performance
     /     |     \
 Clock  CPI   Instruction
 Rate         Count
```

All three must be balanced!

---

## ‚ö° 9. Performance Improvement ‚Äî What Happens When You Change One Factor

- Increasing **Clock Rate** ‚Üí usually increases speed, but may cause more power usage or heat.
    
- Reducing **CPI** ‚Üí possible by simplifying the instruction set (RISC idea).
    
- Reducing **Instruction Count** ‚Üí can be done by a smarter compiler or optimized code.
    

‚ö†Ô∏è Changing one can affect the others ‚Äî they are **interdependent**.

---

## üßÆ 10. Example Problem 1

**Question:**  
A program runs in **10 seconds** on a **400 MHz** computer.  
We want it to run in **6 seconds**, but increasing the clock rate makes the total clock cycles increase by **1.2√ó**.

What is the **minimum clock rate** required?

---

### Step 1: Formula


$$
\text{CPU Time} = \frac{\text{Clock Cycles}}{\text{Clock Rate}}  
$$

We know:

- Old Time = 10s
    
- New Time = 6s
    
- New Cycles = 1.2 √ó Old Cycles
    
- Old Clock Rate = 400 MHz
    

---

### Step 2: Build ratio

[  
$$
\frac{\text{Old Time}}{\text{New Time}} = \frac{\text{Old Clock Cycles} / \text{Old Clock Rate}}{\text{New Clock Cycles} / \text{New Clock Rate}}  
$$
]

Simplify:  
[  
$$
\frac{10}{6} = \frac{1 / 400}{1.2 / \text{New Clock Rate}}  
$$
]

---

### Step 3: Solve for new clock rate

[  
$$
\text{New Clock Rate} = 400 \times \frac{1.2 \times 6}{10}  
$$
]

[  
$$
\text{New Clock Rate} = 288 \text{ MHz}  
$$
]

**Answer:** ‚úÖ Minimum required clock rate = **288 MHz**

---

## üßÆ 11. Example Problem 2

We have two computers, **A** and **B**, that use the same ISA.

|Computer|Clock Cycle Time|CPI|
|---|---|---|
|A|10 ns|2.0|
|B|20 ns|1.2|

Which one is faster?

---

### Step 1: Formula

[  
$$
\text{CPU Time} = \text{IC} \times \text{CPI} \times \text{Clock Cycle Time}  
$$
]

(Since both have same IC, compare CPI √ó Cycle Time)

---

### Step 2: Calculate

- A ‚Üí 2.0 √ó 10 ns = 20 ns
    
- B ‚Üí 1.2 √ó 20 ns = 24 ns
    

**Smaller time = faster processor**

‚úÖ **Computer A** is faster!

---

## üéØ 12. Key Takeaways for Exams

- **Performance = 1 / Execution Time**
    
- **CPU Time = IC √ó CPI √ó Clock Cycle Time**
    
- **Higher clock rate** ‚Üí faster CPU
    
- **Lower CPI** ‚Üí more efficient instructions
    
- **Lower IC** ‚Üí better compiler/programmer
    
- **RISC** = simple instructions, fewer cycles
    
- **CISC** = complex instructions, higher CPI
    
- **Response Time ‚â† Throughput**
    

üß† **Mnemonic:**
