### 🧠 1. Operating System Services

These are the core functions an OS provides to users and programs:

- **User Interface (UI):** Graphical (Windows) or command-line (Linux shell).
- **Program Execution:** Load, run, and terminate applications.
- **I/O Operations:** Manage input/output devices like keyboards and printers.
- **File System Manipulation:** Create, read, write, and delete files.
- **Communication:** Enable processes to talk to each other (e.g., pipes, sockets).
- **Error Detection:** Spot and recover from hardware/software issues.
- **Resource Allocation:** Distribute CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
- **Security & Protection:** Control access to system resources.

🧪 _Example:_ Windows Explorer lets you manage files; Linux shell lets you run commands.

### 🧩 2. System Calls

These are the bridge between user programs and the OS kernel.

- **Process Control:** `fork()`, `exec()` to create and run processes.
- **File Manipulation:** `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`.
- **Device Management:** Communicate with hardware.
- **Information Maintenance:** Get system info.
- **Communication:** Use sockets or pipes for IPC (Inter-Process Communication).

🧪 _Example:_ `printf()` in C internally uses the `write()` system call.

### 🧱 3. Memory Hierarchy

Memory is organized in layers based on speed and size:

|Layer|Speed|Size|
|---|---|---|
|Registers|Fastest|Smallest|
|Cache|Very Fast|Small|
|Main Memory (RAM)|Fast|Medium|
|Secondary Storage|Slowest|Largest|

🧪 _Example:_ OS stores frequently used data in RAM to avoid slow disk access.

### ⚡ 4. Interrupt Processing

Interrupts are signals that grab the CPU’s attention.

**Steps:**

1. Interrupt occurs (e.g., keyboard press).
2. CPU saves current state.
3. Control passes to Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
4. ISR handles the event.
5. CPU resumes previous task.

🧪 _Example:_ When you press a key, the keyboard sends an interrupt to the CPU.

### 🏗️ 5. OS Design & Implementation

Three major architectures:

#### 🔹 Monolithic Kernel

- All services run in kernel space.
- Fast but hard to maintain.
- Example: Linux, MS-DOS.

#### 🔹 Layered Approach

- OS is built in layers.
- Each layer interacts only with adjacent ones.
- Easier to debug and secure.
- Example: THE OS.

#### 🔹 Microkernel

- Minimal kernel; most services run in user space.
- More secure and modular, but slower due to IPC overhead.
- Example: Minix, QNX.
